# 📖 Clustering-Enhanced Facial EmoƟon RecognaƟon Using ELM: A
Hybrid KMeans and PSO Approach 
 <a name="about-project"></a>

**Abstract**  
Recognizing emoƟonal expressions from human faces plays a crucial role in building intelligent
systems for applicaƟons such as affecƟve compuƟng, human-computer interacƟon, and
psychological assessment. In this study, a facial emoƟon recogniƟon (FER) system is developed
and tested on a dataset containing 190,967 samples. These samples are represented by 10 virtual
marker features, derived from facial acƟon units, and collected through an image processing
pipeline involving face and eye detecƟon and marker tracking during emoƟonal expression. This
paper presents a facial emoƟon recogniƟon (FER) system that uses a two-stage approach
combining opƟmized clustering and hybrid machine learning to improve accuracy and processing
efficiency. The system first applies an enhanced K-means algorithm, opƟmized with ParƟcle
Swarm OpƟmizaƟon (PSO), to divide the dataset into five iniƟal clusters based on expression
features. AŌer analyzing the clusters, Clusters 0, 1, 2, and 4—containing clear and easily
recognizable emoƟons—were merged into a single group called Cluster A. Cluster 3, which
included more ambiguous and hard-to-classify expressions, was labeled Cluster B.
Cluster A was processed using an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), which provided fast and
highly accurate results, achieving 99% accuracy. Cluster B was classified using a weighted XGBoost
model, which performed beƩer than tradiƟonal methods, especially on complex samples, and
improved accuracy by 22%. The system It achieved an overall weighted accuracy of 94.59%, while
also reducing processing Ɵme. The proposed method offers a balance between speed and
accuracy, making it suitable for real-Ɵme applicaƟons such as affecƟve compuƟng, humancomputer interacƟon, and psychological assessment.


**Results**  
The developed hybrid facial emoƟon recogniƟon system demonstrated strong performance
across all evaluaƟon metrics. As shown in Table VI, the complete system achieved 94.59% overall
accuracy while maintaining efficient processing Ɵmes. The intelligent rouƟng mechanism
successfully balanced accuracy and computaƟonal requirements by direcƟng expressions to the
appropriate processing path.
